Hello, I'm Joo Min Cheol.
I majored in mechanical engineering when I was an undergraduate.
However, I became deeply interested in AI through one class I took when I was an undergraduate.
I am curious about various industries that can apply AI.
If there is a problem with the code I posted, please feel free to contact me at dao0924@naver.com.
